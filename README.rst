Position: Constants are Critical in Regret Bounds for Reinforcement Learning
****************************************************************************

Simone Drago, Marco Mussi and Alberto Maria Metelli

Running Experiments
===================

The code requires *python3* along with *numpy* and *matplotlib*.

The configurations used for the experiments in the main paper are in the *configs* folder.

To run the experiments on the illustrative environment, from the root directory, call the python script *parallel_runner.py* with as parameter the name of the configuration file (without ".json") inside the *configs* folder.

To run the RiverSwim experiment, call the python script *parallel_runner_riverswim.py*.
